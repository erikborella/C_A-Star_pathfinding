# C_A-Star_pathfinding
A simple implementation of A* algorithm in C

# Compilation:
Compile using GCC Compiler linking the math library with -lm: \
`$ gcc -lm pathfinding.c -o pathfinding`.\
\
And just execute normally: \
`$ ./pathfinding`.

# Still in development

Soon I will create an better inteface.
